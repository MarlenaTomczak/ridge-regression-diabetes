This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates linear regression analysis on the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. The notebook covers building a linear regression model, applying Ridge regularization, tuning the regularization parameter, and comparing results.

Contents:

-Diabetes_Linear_Regression.ipynb â€“ The main notebook containing the following steps:
  1. Load and analyze the dataset
  2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
  3. Build and train a linear regression model
  4. Apply Ridge regularization
  5. Find the best regularization parameter using RidgeCV
  6. Compare results
